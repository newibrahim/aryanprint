# Your book function should have a pass function
# X
# Check if book1 is a object of the class Point

# what does the pass function do?
#The pass statement in Python is used when a statement is required syntactically
# but you do not want any command or code to execute.jjn
# The pass statement is a null operation; nothing happens when it executes.
# Exellent!


# how does the isinstance function work?
#The isinstance() function returns True if the specified object is of the specified type, otherwise False
# Exellent
